Analysis to evaluate the influence of cross-section obliquity on bar width scaling

This code contains the workflow to demonstrate how cross-section obliquity influences bar width scaling. The program "barCut.py" will sample cross-sections at angles from 1-90 degrees to channel-perpendicular, find true channel widths, and finds bar-surface widths. The program will then save this data. The program "analysis.py" produces the figures used for publication. The directory "angle_data/" contains the csv files produced from barCut.py, and used by analysis.py.

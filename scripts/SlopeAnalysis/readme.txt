Code repository to perform the tranverse bed slope analysis on the channel bar dataset.

bar.py: Script to produce .csv of tranverse bed slopes for each cross-section within the data set. 
        Also contains the script used to create Figure 4c.

radiusCurvature.py: Script to produce .csv of bend radii of curvature for each river.
        Also contains the script used to create Figure DR1.

talmon1995.py: Script to produce analysis of predicted bed slopes following Talmon et al. (1995).
            Contains script used to create Figure 4d.

k_taoRivers.csv: .csv file containing river parameters like depth, width, slope, etc.

thetadf.csv: .csv file containing tranvserse bed slopes for each cross-section.

curvature.csv: .csv file contianing radii of curvature for each river bend.
